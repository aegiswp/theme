== Description ==

A native block framework engineered for raw velocity. Aegis loads zero CSS, JavaScript, or font assets by default, delivering a pure architectural foundation. It empowers designers with deep visual controls—including SVG management, fluid typography, and intrinsic responsiveness—while providing developers with a strict, standards-based environment. The definitive foundation for high-performance child themes.
