// Main entry point for the Aegis WordPress Block Theme.
// This file is required by package.json (main) and can serve as a bridge for your theme's JS.

// If you want to expose any global functionality, you can do so here.
// For now, we'll log to confirm the entry point is working.

console.log('Aegis Theme index.js loaded.');

// Optionally, you can import your main TypeScript entry if needed:
// Uncomment the following line if you want to ensure src/index.ts is bundled.
// require('./src/index.ts');

// You can expand this file for front-end scripts, or keep it minimal as a placeholder.
