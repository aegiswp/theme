<?php
/**
 * Main Template File
 *
 * This file is required by WordPress for theme validation, but it does not
 * output any content in a block theme like Aegis. All templating is handled
 * by HTML files in the `templates` and `parts` directories.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Fulfill the WordPress requirement for an `index.php` file.
 * - Remain empty to ensure that block templates take precedence.
 *
 * @package    Aegis
 * @since      1.0.0
 * @author     @atmostfear-entertainment
 * @link       https://github.com/aegiswp/theme
 *
 * For more context on why this file is necessary but empty, see the related
 * WordPress core ticket: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/54272.
