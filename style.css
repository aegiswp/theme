 Description: A native block framework engineered for raw velocity. Aegis loads zero CSS, JavaScript, or font assets by default, delivering a pure architectural foundation. It empowers designers with deep visual controls—including SVG management, fluid typography, and intrinsic responsiveness—while providing developers with a strict, standards-based environment. The definitive foundation for high-performance child themes.

/**
 * Block Theme Styling
 *
 * In a block theme, this file is primarily used for the theme's header
 * information. Most styling is handled by `theme.json` and through the
 * block editor's Styles interface.
 *
 * Custom CSS can still be added here if needed, but the recommended
 * approach is to use `theme.json` for global styles and block-specific
 * styles for components.
