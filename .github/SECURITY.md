# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The team at Armostfear Entertainment takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please use the **"Report a vulnerability"** button on the [Security tab](https://github.com/aegiswp/theme/security).

This will allow you to privately report a vulnerability to the project maintainers.

### What to Expect

After you report a vulnerability, you can expect the following:

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 business days.
- We will provide you with a timeline for addressing the vulnerability.
- We will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed.

We will not disclose your identity without your permission.

### Scope

Please only report vulnerabilities in the latest version of the theme.

Thank you for helping keep Aegis and our users safe.
