### Getting Started with Aeon

To get started with Aeon development:

1. Set up a [WordPress](#deploying-wordpress-locally) instance.
2. Download [Aeon]().
3. Unzip, and upload this repository into your `/wp-content/themes/` directory.

Just in case you find the method to install WordPress locally too overwhelming, then we would recommend experimenting with [wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/), [Local](https://localwp.com/) or [DevKinsta](https://kinsta.com/devkinsta/).

#### Requirements

- [Aeon](https://github.com/alexdeborba/seance)
- [WordPress 6.0+](https://wordpress.org/download/)
- PHP 7.4+
- License: [GPLv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) or later.

Some Aeon features and/or [pull requests](https://github.com/atmostfear-entertainment/aeon/pulls) may require the [Gutenberg plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) trunk and will be described or tagged accordingly.

To optionally run tests locally, it will also be required:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

You can install the test-specific development dependencies by running `npm i && composer install`.

The following test commands are then available:

- `npm run lint:css` lints and autofixes where possible the CSS
- `composer run analyze [filename.php]` statically analyzes PHP for bugs
- `composer run lint` checks PHP for syntax errors
- `composer run standards:check` checks PHP for standards errors according to [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/)
- `composer run standards:fix` attempts to automatically fix errors
