### Getting Started with Aeon

To get started with Aeon development:

1. Set up a [WordPress](#deploying-wordpress-locally) instance.
2. Download [Aeon]().
3. Unzip, and upload this repository into your `/wp-content/themes/` directory.

Just in case you find the method to install WordPress locally too overwhelming, then we would recommend experimenting with [wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/), [Local](https://localwp.com/) or [DevKinsta](https://kinsta.com/devkinsta/).
