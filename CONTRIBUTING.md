# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the Aegis WordPress Block Theme! Whether you are interested in enhancing the theme's functionality with new features, creating new block patterns specifically tailored for Aegis, refining its global styles, improving the theme's code, or participating in beta testing, your contributions are always welcome.

Aegis is built to fully utilize WordPressâ€™s Full Site Editing (FSE) capabilities, allowing for extensive customization directly within the block editor. Contributions can help enhance the theme's flexibility, performance, and user experience, making it even more robust and versatile for a diverse range of users.

To ensure a productive and positive environment, we have a few guidelines:

### General Contribution Guidelines

-   **No Self-Promotion**: Please focus on enhancing the project rather than promoting personal content or services.
-   **Adhere to WordPress Standards**: All contributions must comply with the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/).

If you are unsure about anything, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/aegiswp/theme/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/aegiswp/theme/pulls) for guidance. Even if your contribution needs changes, we will kindly direct you to the appropriate resources or suggest modifications to your pull request.

We aim to foster a welcoming environment for everyone involved. Therefore, all contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/aegiswp/theme/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine:

    ```bash

    ```

3. **Create a New Branch**: Always create a new branch for your contributions:

### Contribution Best Practices

-   **Be Clear and Concise**: When creating issues or pull requests, provide as much context as possible.
-   **Stay Focused**: Keep your commits and pull requests focused on a single issue or feature.
-   **Write Meaningful Commit Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" of the changes, not just the "what."
